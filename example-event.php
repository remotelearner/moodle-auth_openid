 * Example event script for Moodle OpenID auth plugin

 * As part of this implementation, there is a simple system which can respond to
 * events.  The only events we are currently using are:
 *
 * - on_openid_login
 * - on_openid_create_account
 *
 * In order to receive notification of these events, you should rename this file
 * (or create a new one) to event.php.
